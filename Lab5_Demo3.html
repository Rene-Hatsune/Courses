    As in the last demo:
    <ul>
      <li>
        This React demo places the component script in Script2.js in a &quot;js&quot; folder
        and the styles in StyleSheet2.css in a &quot;css&quot; folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        The only script you need in the body is an execution script block at the end
        to execute component code with a ReactDOM.render statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        This means that we can save component scripts in site folders just like ordinary JavaScript
        and stylesheets.  All we need to place on each page is a placeholder div, like the first one
        just after body starts in this page, and a script block at the end that renders the control
        or controls.
      </li>
    </ul>
    This demo also defines three components in the script file: Hello, Goodbye, and App which holds the
    first two.
